Automatically switches to Google Web results to disable AI Overview

Google AI Overview Disabler automatically redirects your searches to the classic "Web" tab, giving you clean, traditional search results without AI-generated content.

✨ What it does
When you search on Google, this extension automatically adds the udm=14 parameter to your URL — the same as clicking the "Web" tab manually, but instant and automatic.

Before: Ads → AI Overview → More Ads → Sponsored → Finally, results
After: Just the search results you're looking for

🚀 Features
• One-click toggle — Easily enable or disable from the popup
• Lightning fast — Uses Chrome's declarativeNetRequest API (no slow scripts)
• Privacy-friendly — No data collection, no tracking, no analytics
• Lightweight — Minimal permissions, tiny footprint

🔒 Permissions explained
• declarativeNetRequest — Required to redirect URLs at the network level
• storage — Saves your on/off preference
• google.com access — Only modifies Google search URLs

💡 How it works
The extension intercepts Google search requests and adds udm=14 to the URL, which tells Google to show the "Web" results view instead of the default AI-enhanced view.
